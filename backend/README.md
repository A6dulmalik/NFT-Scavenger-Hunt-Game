## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## CORS Configuration

The backend is configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for development purposes:

- Frontend Origin: http://localhost:3000
- Allowed Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
- Security Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization
- Credentials: Enabled

### Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add the following environment variables:
   PORT=3001
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NODE_ENV=development

To test if everything is working:

Start your backend (should run on port 3001)
Start your frontend (should run on port 3000)
Make a test request from frontend to backend
Check browser's developer tools Network tab - you should see no CORS errors

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## NFT Scavenger Hunt Backend

This repository contains the backend for the **NFT Scavenger Hunt** application, built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). The backend is responsible for handling authentication, API endpoints, database interactions, and other server-side functionality required for the NFT Scavenger Hunt experience.

## Project Overview

The **NFT Scavenger Hunt** backend provides the server-side logic for managing users, NFTs, hunts, and rewards. It is built using NestJS for its modular architecture and TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

The primary objectives include:

- Managing user authentication and session handling.
- Facilitating interactions with the NFT-related features.
- Providing endpoints for frontend consumption.
- Ensuring a scalable and maintainable backend architecture.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v13 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NFT-scavenger-hunt.git
   cd NFT-scavenger-hunt
   ```

2. **Navigate into the backend folder:**
   navigate into the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   Ensure PostgreSQL is running and create a database for the application.

5. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the required variables (see the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below).

6. **Run database migrations (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   npm run typeorm:run
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables. Ensure they are configured in a `.env` file:

```plaintext
# Database configuration
DATABASE_HOST=localhost                 # Database host
DATABASE_PORT=5432                      # Database port
DATABASE_USER=your_database_user        # Database username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password # Database password
DATABASE_NAME=nft_scavenger_hunt        # Database name
DATABASE_SYNC=true                      # Enable auto-sync for entities (use with caution in production)
DATABASE_LOAD=true                      # Enable autoload of entities (true/false)

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development                    # Application environment (development/production)
API_VERSION=v1                          # API version (e.g., v1)
```

---

## Running the Server

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Run the production server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:prod
   ```

3. **Watch for file changes (hot-reloading):**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:<port>` (default: 3000).

---

## Testing Endpoints

You can test the API endpoints using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [cURL](https://curl.se/).

1. Start the server (see [Running the Server](#running-the-server)).
2. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000/api/<version>` (replace `<version>` with the configured API version).

---

## API Documentation

The application uses [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation. Once the server is running, you can access the documentation at:

- **Swagger UI:** `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`

This provides detailed information about all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
